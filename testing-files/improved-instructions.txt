Current Instructions:
### Instructions: Your task is to convert a question into a one-line SQL query, given a MYSQL database schema. Adhere to these rules:
- **Deliberately go through the question and database schema word by word** to appropriately answer the question
- **Use Table Aliases** to prevent ambiguity. For example, `SELECT table1.col1, table2.col1 FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id`.
- When creating a ratio, always cast the numerator as float

- **Use Table Aliases** to prevent ambiguity. For example, `SELECT table1.col1, table2.col1 FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id`.
- When creating a ratio, give it as a float and not an integer
- Break down questions individual steps/columns
- Never create more than 2 columns to answer a question
- Always join and label the columns being returned
- Do not use any of the following functions: quarter, weekofyear, time_format, dayname, time_format'
Use the following examples of different ways to solve questions as reference:

Example Questions-
Example #1, A group-by question: What is the total number of citations received by each author?, break it into the following steps:
Step 1: Identify the publications written by each author SELECT aid, pid  FROM writes;
Step 2: Determine the number of citations received by each publication- SELECT pid, citation_num  FROM publication;
Step 3: Combine the author and citation data- SELECT w.aid, p.citation_num  FROM writes w JOIN publication p ON w.pid = p.pid;
Step 4: Sum the total number of citations for each author- SELECT aid, SUM(citation_num) AS total_citations FROM (
SELECT w.aid, p.citation_num  FROM writes w JOIN publication p ON w.pid = p.pid
) AS author_citations GROUP BY aid; GROUP BY aid;
Step 5: Join with the author table to display names - SELECT a.name, ac.total_citations FROM (SELECT aid, SUM(citation_num) AS total_citations 
FROM (SELECT w.aid, p.citation_num FROM writes w JOIN publication p ON w.pid = p.pid) AS author_citations GROUP BY aid) AS ac
JOIN author a ON ac.aid = a.aid;
Example #2, An order-by question: What is the average number of references cited by publications in each domain name?
Step 1: Identify the publications associated with each domain- SELECT did, pid  FROM domain_publication;
Step 2: Calculate the number of references cited by each publication- SELECT pid, reference_num  FROM publication;
Step 3: Combine the domain and reference data- SELECT dp.did, p.reference_num  FROM domain_publication dp JOIN publication p ON dp.pid = p.pid;
Step 4: Calculate the average number of references cited by publications for each domain- SELECT did, AVG(reference_num) AS avg_references
FROM (SELECT dp.did, p.reference_num  FROM domain_publication dp JOIN publication p ON dp.pid = p.pid) AS domain_references
GROUP BY did;
Example #3, a ratio question: Which author had the most publications in the year 2021 and how many publications did he/she have that year?
Step 1: Identify the publications made in the year 2021- SELECT pid  FROM publication WHERE year = 2021;
Step 2: Identify the authors of these publications- SELECT w.aid, w.pid FROM writes w JOIN publication p ON w.pid = p.pid WHERE p.year = 2021;
Step 3: Count the number of publications for each author- SELECT aid, COUNT(pid) AS publication_count FROM (SELECT w.aid, w.pid FROM writes w
JOIN publication p ON w.pid = p.pid WHERE p.year = 2021) AS author_publications GROUP BY aid;
Step 4: Find the author with the most publications- SELECT aid, publication_count FROM (SELECT aid, COUNT(pid) AS publication_count
FROM (SELECT w.aid, w.pid FROM writes w JOIN publication p ON w.pid = p.pid WHERE p.year = 2021) AS author_publications GROUP BY aid
) AS publication_counts ORDER BY publication_count DESC LIMIT 1;
Example #4, a table join question: Which author had the most publications in the year 2021 and how many publications did he/she have that year?
Step 1: Identify publications made in 2021- SELECT pid FROM publication WHERE year = 2021;
Step 2: Identify the authors of these publications- SELECT w.aid, w.pid FROM writes w JOIN publication p ON w.pid = p.pid
WHERE p.year = 2021;
Step 3: Count the number of publications for each author- SELECT aid, COUNT(pid) AS publication_count FROM (
SELECT w.aid, w.pid FROM writes w JOIN publication p ON w.pid = p.pid WHERE p.year = 2021
) AS author_publications GROUP BY aid;
Step 4: Find the author with the most publications- SELECT aid, publication_count FROM (SELECT aid, COUNT(pid) AS publication_count
FROM (SELECT w.aid, w.pid FROM writes w JOIN publication p ON w.pid = p.pid WHERE p.year = 2021) AS author_publications GROUP BY aid
) AS publication_counts ORDER BY publication_count DESC LIMIT 1;
With these examples in mind, given a MYSQL schema, create a query that answers the question, ONLY RETURN THE SQL QUERY and this query should be enclosed in "<" and ">".
